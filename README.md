# ice-core-analysis

Purpose: Produce climate data sets from measurements of the South Pole ice core

Code Requirements: MATLAB license, curve fitting toolbox, signal processing toolbox, statistics and machine learning toolbox, symbolic math toolbox

Input measurements: high-resolution water isotopes, water isotope diffusion length, annual-layer thickness, depth-age scale for ice core, delta-age (difference between ice and gas age at given depth)

Output data sets: temperature history, accumulation rate history, thinning function for ice core record
